# Python OOP
## Why OOP

## Four pillars of OOP (with use cases)
### Abstraction
- The user doesn't need to know how everything works
- They only need to know how to perform the tasks they need to
- E.g. a driver doesn't need to know how the engine works, only how to drive the car

### Encapsulation
- Allows for information to remain private and only accessible from certain locations
- E.g. you may make name available everywhere, but keep date of birth private

### Inheritance
- A class can inherit attributes and methods from a parent class
- E.g. Mammal inherits the `eat()` and `sleep()` methods from a parent Animal class

### Polymorphism
- Data from the parent class can also be overridden
- E.g. Snake class contains `legs = False`, which overrides the `legs = True` attribute inherited from Reptile class
